# State of the art {#state}

A multirotor UAV may carry different payloads for different use cases but predominantly the payload is a video or photo camera. The video and photos can be used for 3D mapping, search and rescue operations, inspecting powerlines, surveilance, inspecting wind turbine structural integrity, counting deer in woods or simply capturing cinematic footage to name a few. However the act of piloting itself is secondary to the goal. The act of piloting is nessecary to gather data with the payload. A pilot needs to have certain skills and training to be able to safely operate an airial vehicle. The cost of hiring a pilot can be much higher than the operational costs of the UAV and payload combined. Thus companies across the globe look to simplify the piloting. 

In movie industry camera drones are used with two people. One person to pilot the multirotor and one person to manipulate the camera. This has the overhead of hiring two people and the multirotor and the expencive payload. For the high-end movie industry this is fine. Where this overhead becomes prohibitive is in the industrial applications. To inspect powerlines atleast one person is needed to do the piloting and directing of the camera. The video analysis can be done during the flight or later. To keep the needs of man power to a minimum the operator needs to be able to operate the multirotor aswell as the camera and know enough of the powerlines to analyse the video feed. Another option is to have two people - one to pilot and film and a second one to do the analysis. The operator however might not film the correct parts for the analyst to do his job. Thus introducing the risk that the collected data is unusable. In the case of powerlines not only a single pylon needs to be inspected, rather several hundred kilometers worth need to be assessed at a time. Having a single person drive to each location to fly a multirotor would take a very long time for a single person and as the person needs to be highly trained the process would become prohibitively expencive. This problem is smaller when it comes to tele-communications companies as they have single cell towers which allways need to be inspected one at a time. For the energy sector a multirotor is prohibitively expencive and not because of the device costs but rather the manpower costs.

The energy sector could use multirotors, but they have a more cost effective way of detecting faults. The method involves renting a full size helicopter with a pilot and fitting it with a expencive camera and camera operator to fly over the powerlines at the right angles to later analyse the photos or video taken. This has a higher chanche of missing faults but compared to multirotors is cheaper alternative.

Automating the missions to inspect powerlines or cell towers requires high intelligence on the part of the autopilot and will not be assesed in this thesis. Instead search and resque missions and surveilance missions are assesed. These missions have the potential to be simplified to the point where additional training on the part of the pilot is not needed.

To find a person lost in woods a mission such as seen on figure \@ref(fig:scanning) is used. To execute such a mission the pilot needs to take into account several variables such as wind speed and battery condition. A naive simplification to piloting can be made by limiting the maximum disturbance (wind) allowed by forcibly landing when such disturbance is detected. This sets a hard limit to the conditions an unskilled pilot can fly in. By enforcing such a limit the risk of failure can be minimized and the producer of the multirotor would feel alot better about their product. A skilled pilot however would be able to fly and potentially save someones life in that situation. A better aproach is needed.

Area surveilance requires an automated mission that allows for specification of the camera direction and angle. A mission to survey the fences of a military compound would have to include waypoints that specify the locations the multirotor flies to and the locations or directions the multirotor camera is turned to while flying. While building such a mission takes some knowledge of the software the actual mission takes no input from a pilot (unless desired) and can be used the same way a regular camera video is used. When the viewer of the video feed spots that something is wrong, the multirotor could be set to manual control mode to be used as flying camera in a similar fashion to PTZ cameras. Such systems could be used instead of stationary cameras in cases where the areas are to big to have stationary camera infrastructure or change rapidly. Given the naive solution to dealing with different weather conditions outlined above would leave the area vulnerable every time the weather conditions exceed the piloting abilities of an untrained pilot. To remedy this the autopilot needs to be able to adjust to the weather conditions in the same way an experienced pilot would.
