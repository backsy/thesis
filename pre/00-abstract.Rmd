This thesis explores how to achieve consecutive autonomous flights without a pilots input. Previously the focus of research has been in optimizing the flight characteristics of a multirotor but we take a higher level approach to find the requirements needed to be able to achieve fully autonomous flight with use cases in the industry.

We created _python_ code to import data from individual log files into a database. An algorithm for filtering the database to find necessary data to design a model of the flight behavior of an individual multirotor is created. An analysis of voltage graphs of the available flights were analyzed and a requirement for a smart controller in each battery to monitor the state of charge, state of health and to identify each battery is found.

This thesis is written in English and is 35 pages long, including 4 chapters, 16 figures and 8 tables.
